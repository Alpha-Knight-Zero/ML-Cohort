This is the task submission for the third task of the pre-requisite session.

The dataset had to be reorganized by code to match the format of the training set having folder with all the categories , which then contain all the images that belong to that category.

In the absence of a pre-defined test set the validation set was used to show validation accuracy and it was created as a exclusive set of images from within the test set , by code. 

The screenshot of the model accuracy is attached.
